Symlinks make file ops complicated. There are various flags for
following links, e.g. -H, -P, -L for cp; similar but different flags
for other ops. These behaviors have to be implemented.

The pathlib rules for when symlinks are followed are complicated and
sometimes not helpful. E.g. resolve() always follows symlinks.

There are lots of cases to consider: non-existent, file, dir, symlink
to file, symlink to dir, broken symlink, symlink to another symlink,
to ... file or dir or nothing.  Symlinks of files listed on the
command-line can differ from those found during recursive exploration
of directories (the cp flags). And the cartesian product of these for
each op, e.g. move a file to a symlink to a directory.

Idea:

Encapsulate this logic in an abstract base class. It is basically a 2d
grid of functions, e.g. a function for handling (FROM symlink-to-file,
TO dir). An implementation of this class gives the set of functions
for a given op.

Also need a 1d version for operations like rm and ls. (So the 2nd
dimension would be N/A).


- NOTHING (does not exist)
- FILE
- DIR
- LINK_TO_NOTHING
- LINK_TO_FILE
- LINK_TO_DIR
- TOP_LINK_TO_NOTHING
- TOP_LINK_TO_FILE
- TOP_LINK_TO_DIR

Can link to link to ... X be treated as LINK_TO_X?




NOTHING              = 0x1
FILE                 = 0x2
DIR                  = 0x3
LINK                 = 0x4
TOP                  = 0x8
TOP_LINK             = TOP | LINK
LINK_TO_NOTHING      = LINK | NOTHING
LINK_TO_FILE         = LINK | FILE
LINK_TO_DIR          = LINK | DIR
TOP_LINK_TO_NOTHING  = TOP_LINK | NOTHING
TOP_LINK_TO_FILE     = TOP_LINK | FILE
TOP_LINK_TO_DIR      = TOP_LINK | DIR

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Can't separate the action from the op. op carries lots of state
relevant for execution. I.e., can't have a standalone mapping from
(source path type, target path type) to action.

Also: 2d dispatch is overkill. A single op execution could have many
sources, but there is only one target. 

Putting this together:

- op setup knows the target. Pick a dispatch table for the target's
  type.

- Use the dispatch inside op.action(self, source).

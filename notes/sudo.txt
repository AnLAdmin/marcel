Executing marcel ops and Linux command as sudo

Explanation of how sudo works: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/126914/how-does-sudo-really-work

This isn't available to marcel. E.g., bash doesn't have the setuid bit set.

So there doesn't seem to be any alternative to using a subprocess
prefixed with sudo.

Implementation alternatives:

- Use farcel.py, sending pipeline in and getting results.

- Enable marcel to be invoked with command line (e.g. piped in, via
  Linux pipe). Capture output.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

sudo ls  # I.e., marcel ls

- Run farcel.py LOCALLY (as a subprocess) under sudo.

- Pipe the ls command to it.

Need to allow for tab-completion of sudo commands?

Allow sudo mid-pipeline

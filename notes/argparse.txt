Keep argparse?

Reasons for using argparse:

- arg parsing

- arg checking

- command help

Reality:

- Command help isn't that good. Had to write my own formatter. 

- setup_1() needs to check args, to support API. This duplicates the
  checking by argparse.

- argparse is geared to strings. Need hacks for other things. E.g. the
  pipeline_reference hack. More of this would be needed for expr args.

  argparse type doesn't really work for pipelines. The problem is that
  for this mechanism, the arg has to be a string visible to the type
  function. But pipelines aren't formed from a single string, they are
  formed from the parse of lots of strings.

Replacing argparse:

- args is just a sequence of tokens. Might want to add a Flag token
  type.

- setup_1() would have to do arg checking: required flags, mutual
  exclusion, types, etc.

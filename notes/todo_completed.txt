- Pipline pickling (replace/restore function)

- PickleableException (transmission of stacks): Stacks aren't
  reported, but errors are now transmissible.

- remove_cr_lf

- clone (pickling)

- scp, ssh via spawning. Is there a native way to do this?

- print_stack

- Forks

- Write OshArgParser.exit to avoid SystemExit on argparse error.

- CommandKiller shouldn't print stack. (dev only),
  default_exception_handler too.

- Get rid of default and related exception handlers? (See ideas.txt on replacing stderr.)

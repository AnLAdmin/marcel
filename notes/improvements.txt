- Highlight color for broken link. Not trivial, because File needs to
  survive pickling. Can't assume that file can be examined when
  colorization is needed. And stat (computed before pickling) doesn't
  indicate whether the file exists. Could check and record this.

- fg/bg without specifying job#

- Syntax for starting job in background (like bash &). Maybe 
  bg [ ... ]? Awkward to recall and then edit.

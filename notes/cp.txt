Interesting flags from bash cp man page:

       --attributes-only
              don't copy the file data, just the attributes

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       -d     same as --no-dereference --preserve=links

       -H     follow command-line symbolic links in SOURCE

       -l, --link
              hard link files instead of copying

       -L, --dereference
              always follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -n, --no-clobber
              do not overwrite an existing file (overrides a previous -i option)

       -P, --no-dereference
              never follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -R, -r, --recursive
              copy directories recursively

       -s, --symbolic-link
              make symbolic links instead of copying


-H: What does this do?

-L: What does this do? Sounds like -H. See the find man page. Find has
HLP flags relating to symlinks. Seems to be related.

-s: Seems like ln -s, except that it has to stay in the same directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Initially, do:


  -l: Create a hard link to the file
  -P: Copy symlink as is. If link target is relative, then copy may not make sense.
  -r

----------------------------------------------------------------------

cp can create hard links and symbolic links. This overlaps with the ln
command. (ln does hard link, or symbolic if -s specified.)

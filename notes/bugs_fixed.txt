FIXED?

2: Line wrapping is broken, (when typing commands)

See GNU readline horizontal-scroll-mode.

I think this is fixed (see util.py). But if not, I was about to send
this to stackoverflow:

I am implementing a shell with some novel features, in Python 3. My code uses the input() function and readline module to read command lines, support command history, line editing, and so on. I'm passing a prompt, which includes ANSI escape codes (for color) to the input function, and things are mostly working.

But occasionally, something will go wrong:

- Only a prefix of the prompt is printed.

- If I recall a command and edit it, the editing goes to the wrong position within the line.

- Sometimes, typing a long line, wrapping will occur far too early, before the end of the terminal line is reached.

These problems are not highly reproducible. However, so far, it appears that omitting the ANSI escapes from the prompt fixes the problem.

I have googled this problem extensively, and the closest match I've been able to locate is this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17432993/adding-ansi-color-escape-sequences-to-a-bash-prompt-results-in-bad-cursor-positi. But this seems to be a different problem. (My problem seems involves input(), the readline module, and the underlying GNU readline library, not bash.)

I'm looking for advice on a direction to pursue.

4. Receive_complete called too many times following remote fork

@jao [ gen 3 ] | red . +

Should produce (localhost, 3). But it produces that output TWICE.

8. Fix rendering of links

- Color schema shows link using same color as directory in
  prompt. Confusing.

- Show link and target (different colors)

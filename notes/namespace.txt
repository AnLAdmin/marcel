Environment variables, .marcel.py, configuration, globals

All these things are muddy right now.

- Environment has _vars which includes:

  - USER, HOME, HOST, PWD: environment variables.

  - Everything from .marcel.py, which is:

    - from marcel.config import * (which is a bad idiom, apparently),
      which brings in: Cluster, everything in the colorscheme module,
      COLOR_SCHEME, VERSION.

    - My marcel.py: from math import *, datetime, a few functions, a Cluster (jao), 
      a ColorScheme (jao_term), image_highlight, PROMPT, CONTINUATION_PROMPT, COLOR_SCHEME
      (overriding marcel.config)

- These are accessible via Environment.globals(), which gets used to
  eval function source code for function-valued args (e.g. map).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reconsidering these pieces:

- The pythonic way is to have namespaces, probably nested. Could root
  these in the environment.

- .marcel.py definitions must be available to commands: cluster
  definitions, functions.

- .marcel.py is also a convenient place to specify prompts, and the
  colors they use. But if these specifications define symbols, those
  symbols are available in the namespace used for functions. So maybe
  do something like this to avoid introducing symbols:

  CLUSTERS.define(name='jao',
                  hosts=['jao1', 'jao2'],
                  user='jao',
                  identity='/home/jao/.ssh/id_rsa')

  Is CLUSTERS and environment var? Does it come from marcel.config?
  Could be a class, and "define" a static method.




Environment variables:

- USER
- HOME
- HOST
- PWD
- PROMPT
- CONTINUATION_PROMPT
- VERSION

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bash vars:

- Setting all vars seems to be possible. Setting USER doesn't seem to
  affect anything, e.g. the prompt. Setting PWD changes the directory
  that shows up in the prompmt, but doesn't change the actual current
  directory.

- Is there a pythonic way of creating read-only vars? There doesn't
  appear to be.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some env vars are predefined. OK for marcel.config to bring them
in. Either use "from marcel.config import *" or implementation has to
do manipulation of namespaces to get them to be effectively global in
the .marcel.py namespace.

Clusters.define (above) is OK for defining clusters.

Colors, color schemes and prompts:

- PROMPT and CONTINUATION_PROMPT are predefined env vars. They are of
  type Prompt.

- Build up to specifying a prompt colorscheme:

ColorSchemes.define('jao_term')
Colors.define('jao_term', 'user_highlight', 0, 2, 1, bold=True)
Colors.define('jao_term', 'dir_highlight', 0, 3, 3, bold=True)
PROMPT.set_colorscheme('jao_term')

It would be nice to do this with symbols (jao_term) instead of strings
('jao_term') but then those symbols are in the global namespace.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Environment.__init__:

- sets USER, HOME, HOST, PWD env vars.

- execs config file

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Design:

.marcel.py DOES NOT NEED "from marcel.config import *".

Call exec of .marcel.py with:

  - globals: the define_ functions to be used inside exec
  - locals: empty

After the exec call:

- globals will have __builtins__. Keep that.  

- locals will have all the symbols in the exec'd codes
  namespace. I.e., anything that was imported or defined.

For function calls, construct globals out of locals and the rescued
__builtins__.

The config script is loaded at startup, and it defines the initial
marcel namespace: Imports symbols, defines symbols, also uses builtin
functions and vars (e.g. PROMPT) to configure things. 

As of a few days ago, a modification to this file causes it to be
reloaded. This works by discarding the current Main object and
creating a new one. But that loses any session changes,
e.g. assignments to vars. And if there were an import op, it's changes
would be lost too. Example:

- In marcel, assign a value to a new var, e.g. a = asdf
- touch ~/.marcel.py
- Evaluate (a): Error: Running map(lambda: a): name 'a' is not defined

Avoiding this creates a merge problem -- diverging changes in the
session and in the modified config file. Try this:

- Before redoing Main(), keep the old namespace.

- Reread config, and merge it into the old namespace,
  i.e. old_namespace.update(new_namespace). This keeps the old
  namespace, and on conflict, the new namespace wins. Rationale: The
  config file just changed. Why would you keep an older definition?

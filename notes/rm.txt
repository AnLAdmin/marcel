rm behavior

Listing things to be removed is convenient. So is recursion.

But it is more general to have a pipeline feeding into rm. The
pipeline can do recursion, filtering, etc.

Allow both?

    rm [FILENAME ...]

If filenames are given, then rm must be first in pipeline.

If filenames are omitted, then remove piped-in files.

Flags:

- No recursion flag. Handle that via pipeline.

- -s|--safe flag: Don't remove non-empty directories

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ls ... | rm

- Similar to find . | xargs rm

- ls -r would locate directories before contained files. So:

      ls -r ... | rm

  would delete d before d/f. So when we get to d/f, it's
  gone. Actually, it's weirder than that. Would ls succeed as it tries
  to iterate over d?

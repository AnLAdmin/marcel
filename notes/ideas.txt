Argument invocation from Nu: https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2020/06/09/nushell_0_15_0.html

Pipeline used to provide arg value. Sort of like API gather or
first. Functions are already allowed, so this is easy.

- Object introspection via command.

- Understand textual formats, e.g. json. "open" command to open a file
  and pipe it.

- Look into direnv. Nushell has some idea of location-sensitive
  environment. A directory is a "shell", and I guess has its own
  environment.

- Complete Python string parsing

- Complete shell string parsing (termination on things other than EOL
  and whiteapce).

- Debugging & verbosity level

----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Organize internal ops -- Fork, LabelThread

- How do exit codes fit in?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Provide a way to specify farcel config path. Maybe as a property of
the cluster.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Distinct color for broken symlink.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tab completion:

- Tab completion for command should distinguish between first op of
  pipeline and subsequent ones. I.e., only show those ops that can be
  used in the current position within the pipeline.

- Tab completion for directory should include / at end.

- Tab completion for file should include ' ' at end.

- Tab completion with more alternatives should end on the last common
  character.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Add notion of current job, and then allow bg/fg ops to omit args.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Would multiprocessing.Process provide better streaming than
subprocess.Popen? I.e., not waiting for op to complete.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Import bash env?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Should help output go through more?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration:

- Look in ~, /etc/marcel.

- Be able to specify config file (or multiple locations) in startup.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

History commands

- If history were in the namespace, then edited_command wouldn't need
  special handling.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

timer: allow interval to be an int or real (#sec)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Not all ops can be used in API, e.g. edit, help. What about fork? remote?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

API needs documentation. help? HTML?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Exit codes? (Not just an api issue)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

window: what is supposed to happen if overlap = 0? disjoint = 0? Not tested.
test types other than int

----------------------------------------------------------------------

sudo has a zillion args. How to express this on sudo()? **kwargs?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

todo: fork doc describes remote execution. Doesn't discuss @int, or
@sequence. Does @sequence even work? Non-remote versions are kind of
useless without more interesting kinds of sequences, and a way for
each copy of the pipeline to access the label.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

first constructs an Exception out of an Error.

Is it feasible to have Error carry the original exception, and reraise
it, or at least an exception of the same type? What if the Error was
remote?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ls spacing is too wide. How to pick a width? Buffer results? Don't
buffer and adapt?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is broken: Op.op_name() evalutes to "op".

    @staticmethod
    def check_arg(ok, arg, message):
        if not ok:
            cause = (f'Incorrect usage of {Op.op_name()}: {message}'
                     if arg is None else
                     f'Incorrect value for {arg} argument of {Op.op_name()}: {message}')
            raise marcel.exception.KillCommandException(cause)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Import selected bash env variables? Can't see anything other than
EDITOR right now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ps lines are often long enough to wrap. Should render_full leave off
args? If so, then provide an args method.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What if there are two shells running at the same time -- how is
history file maintained? Probably lose updates from the first one to
exit. How should this be handled? To be safe, on exit, should read,
append, write. Atomically.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

API has fork and remote, and they are bound bound to Fork. remote
*intended* for remote execution. 

Need both remote and fork ops?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Should jobs and commands be objects? That would allow for better
formatting.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Should {...} work as a glob pattern? It does in bash. pathlib.Path.glob
doesn't.

ls -fr ~/git/marcel/{marcel,test} \
| select (f: f.suffix == '.py') \
| map (f: f.readlines()) \
| expand \
| red count
No qualifying paths: ['~/git/marcel/{marcel,test}']

----------------------------------------------------------------------

cat = [ map (f: (f, f.readlines())) | expand 1 ]
(cat)

prints:

    pipeline(map(f: (f, f.readlines())) | expand(1))

It would be nice to have the original source.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

These commands do different things:

    ls -fr **/*.py
    ls -fr | select (f: f.suffix == '.py')

The first one avoids symlinks (or symlinks to visited directories? or
files?). The second one explores both paths.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I keep forgetting to set pipeline's error handler. Could be done by
Pipeline.copy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

env has paths as strings. Should be Paths.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ls API: Need to complain if depth is other than 0 or 1

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Exhaustive type error testing in API?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

stack traces: Include them, but have print_stack check a flag to
determine if they should really be printed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TestBase.reset_environment does too much. Move everything but Main
construction into subclasses.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Controlling Popen processes:

https://pymotw.com/2/subprocess/#process-groups-sessions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Pipelines:

- In parser, the create_op_variable check is useless. The variable
  value could change before execution, and may even cease to
  exist. Make create_op_variable the last resort, and then at runtime,
  complain if the var isn't defined, or if it's value is of the wrong
  type.

- Allow [...] to delimit a pipeline, even when not necessary. (Like {
  ... } around single statement if, in C.)


Should assign allow assignment of pipeline without brackets?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Should a var hide an op by the same name?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Oops, [] is overloaded:

M-0.9.17 jao@cheese:/tmp/csv$ ls [b-f]*.csv
Operator ls: filenames must be a string: [runpipeline(b-f)]

But escaping works:

M-0.10.6 jao@cheese:~$ ls \[p-r\]*
-rw-rw-r--   jao    jao       36883   2020 Jul 05 19:23:14   passwords.txt
-rw-r--r--   jao    jao       13377   2019 Jan 20 12:43:37   reality_distortion_field.md

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Can't run ssh!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

EDITOR set to host's EDITOR on startup. Which is convenient, but odd
if host value changes. How to keep the two in sync? Maybe reporting
EDITOR should always get the value of os.getenv('EDITOR')?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Nushell uses $it for current pipeline item. Not a bad
idea. Alternative to args (without --all).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tab completion:

- We often know when an op ends. Can tab-complete for |, >, >>, [, ], Enter.

- We sometimes know when an arg is not a flag. Can prompt for var, (, [.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Help needs to discuss >, >>, pipeline params.

help pipeline, examples summing filesizes are inconsistent. Unclear
that early ones compute local sum of sizes, and later ones are global.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

In api functions, why [None] instead of []? E.g., in store()

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator and pipeline logging, easily controllable, is needed. Can
this be done avoiding runtime penalty when logging not in use?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Error handling needs to be revisited.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ls abc.{x,y}

is not parsed properly, because the comma is its own token.

Could fix this by recognizing COMMA only in the right context. (Lexer
would need to know Parser state.)

OR: in the context that a comma is used, look for string instead, and
check that it is a comma.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arg checking (derived from bug 129):

Doing parse-time checking isn't sufficient. A check is also needed at
execution time, for args that need to be evaluated. The conversion
functions in ArgsParser (e.g. str_to_int) don't really allow for that
second use, as they are tied to the ArgsParser object, which isn't
available at runtime. They could *almost* be made independent of
ArgsParser, but there are some dependencies:

- self.op_name: op isn't available during arg parsing. 

- self.env

- self.current_op: For function(). Need to revisit error handling
  (which is why f.set_op(self.current_op) is called), and perhaps get
  rid of this call.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Line numbers?

This one keeps coming up. Handling the first element of a stream
differently from the rest. I wrote this script to sum up some, but not
all columns of a csv file (from nasuni consulting):

    #!/usr/bin/python3
    
    import sys
    
    from marcel.api import *
    
    
    def keep(acc, x):
        return x
    
    
    run(
        read(sys.argv[1], csv=True) |
        head(1) |
        out(file=sys.argv[2],csv=True)
    )
    run(
        read(sys.argv[1], csv=True) |
        head(-1) |
        map(lambda t, m, v, pk, d, h, rl, ul: (float(t),
                                               int(m),
                                               int(v) * 5000000000,
                                               int(pk),
                                               int(d),
                                               int(h),
                                               int(rl),
                                               int(ul))) |
        red(keep, r_plus, keep, r_plus, r_plus, r_plus, r_plus, r_plus, incremental=True) |
        map(lambda *x: x[len(x)//2:]) |
        out(append=sys.argv[2], csv=True)
    )

This reads the input file twice, once for the header (head(1)), once
for the data (head(-1)). It would be nice to do everything in one pass, e.g.

    read(sys.argv[1], csv=True) |
    ifelse ???first line??? [out(file=sys.argv[2],csv=True)] | 
    red ...

How should the predicate be expressed?

- Could write a predicate on the input line. In this case, detecting
  the first (headings) line of a csv file. But hard to do it reliably,
  and its different for every application.

- Function or variable yielding row#?

- Each op could have a counter.

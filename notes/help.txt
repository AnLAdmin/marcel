ArgParser cleanup

Cleanup ArgParser so that a ColorScheme can be supplied to it, so that
help messages can be colorized.

- parse: 

  + Pass in op_modules from Main.
  + Use it instead of OP_MODULES.
  + Parser no longer needs global_state (it was just attached to the
    arg parser)

- ArgParsers

  + Take global_state as input, save on marcel.core.ArgParser.
  - Get help strings: description, epilog, from the module,
    and pass the to the ArgParser constructor, or otherwise attach
    them to the ArgParser.

- core ArgParser

  - Colorize the description and epilog using colorscheme obtained from
    global_state.

- Ops

  + Get rid of argparser class field.
  + Get rid of arg_parser() function from ops and core.Op.

- Other cleanup

  - Eliminate dependencies of marcel modules on marcel.op
    modules. E.g. out, used by Command.

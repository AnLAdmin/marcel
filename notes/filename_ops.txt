Filename ops

- cp
- mv
- ln
- rm

The design of these is muddled. The names match those of the
corresponding linux commands. They strive to provide compatible
behavior, e.g. for symlinks. But the options are differently named (cp
-P vs. cp -N) or different -- marcel has fewer options; -r is
omitted from cp because it is always implied.

They don't really benefit from a re-implementation, e.g. being in the
middle of a pipeline. And when necessary, fitting into a pipeline is
doable.

What are the benefits of re-implementing?

- More consistent (with marcel) error handling.

- Built-in xargs capability, (piping in files to be acted upon).
